pa_ppx Version 0.02
-------------------

* [16 Aug 2020] update build process to save pp_MLast.ml[i] generated
  files in dirs named by camlp5 version.  update to sync with camlp5
  8.00~alpha02.

* [01 Aug 2020] fixed bugs in handling of attributes of type-derivers.
  Now, it should be the case that if two type-derivers declare that
  they use the same attribute-names (e.g. "name", "nobuiltin") and in
  any compilation unit (e.g. file) they both use such an attribute
  (even if not in the same type-declaration), then attribute-names
  MUST be qualified with the deriver-name (e.g. "yojson.name",
  "sexp.name").  This guarantees that there can be no confusion about
  which attributes refer to which derivers.

* [30 Jul 2020] (minor) update generated pretty-printers (add newlines between items).
